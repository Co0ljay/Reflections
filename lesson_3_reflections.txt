When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A local repo is only useful when you are working on something that is not ready for the 
	public consumption yet or it is proprietary.  
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I would prefer pulling the changes manually, rather than Git pushing it down, or pulling it
	up.  There may be a conflict in code or there may be a bug that I am working on that I do not
	want to push up until the correct fix has been applied.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

	A Fork is to copy a repo with credit to the creator.  This will be online and no local copy will
	be present.
	A clone is to copy a repo with credit to the creator to your local machine to edit and upload
	to your own repo, should you wish to do so
	A branch is a copy of your own code that you are enhancing.  This is to safeguard your working
	code base.
	
	One would use a fork to copy a repo, with credit from the creator and be able to modify it to
	you own liking.  To clone a repo, you can create a local copy of the repo to edit and update
	to your own liking.
